                        27.7% of all new cancers detected in women in India in the year 2018 were breast cancers.Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening.Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be fatal.

                        Breast cancer encompasses a range of distinct types, each characterized by unique characteristics and behaviors. The most common form is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), which begins in the milk ducts, spreads to nearby tissues, and can potentially metastasize to other parts of the body. On the other hand, Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) originates in the lobules and may not always form a distinct lump, making it harder to detect. Triple-Negative Breast Cancer lacks estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2/neu receptors, posing challenges in treatment options. Conversely, HER2-Positive Breast Cancer involves overexpression of the HER2/neu gene and may respond well to targeted therapies. Additionally, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is considered non-invasive as it remains within the milk ducts, while Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a rare, aggressive type characterized by redness, swelling, and warmth in the breast. Understanding these various breast cancer types is essential for tailored treatment and prognosis.

                        Recognizing breast cancer signs is crucial for early detection. These signs may include discovering a new lump, noticing changes in breast size or shape, experiencing unexplained pain or tenderness, observing skin changes like redness or dimpling, and encountering nipple abnormalities such as inversion, discharge, or scaling. Additionally, be vigilant about persistent changes in breast texture or the appearance of swollen lymph nodes in the underarm area. While these symptoms don't confirm cancer, consulting a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation is essential. Regular breast self-exams and mammograms are key components of maintaining breast health and facilitating early detection.

                        The diagnosis of breast cancer involves several steps. It starts with a clinical breast examination, followed by mammography. If necessary, further tests like ultrasound and MRI may be conducted. A definitive diagnosis is often made through a breast biopsy, where a small tissue sample is analyzed in a lab.

                        Once diagnosed, additional tests determine the extent of the disease, including its stage. These diagnostic steps are crucial for developing a personalized treatment plan tailored to the specific characteristics of the breast cancer.
